## Implementation Guide 
You **don't** need to follow this guide strictly.

### Pokemon List Screen ###

#### 1. Set up RecyclerView in `PokemonListFragment.kt` ####
You don't need to create a layout for **Pokemon List Screen** by yourself. We've provided `pokemon_list_fragment.xml` as the layout of  **Pokemon List Screen**, and the layout for each item in `RecyclerView` is defined in `pokemon_view_holder.xml`. What left for you to do is create new files to get the `RecyclerView` ready for displaying data from API.

#### 2. Calling Api ####
Call this endpoint **https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon** to get paginated list of Pokemons. Use the fields; `count`, `next`, and `previous` to make the `RecyclerView` load and display the data in the pagination way.

#### 3. Passing URL to Pokemon Detail ####
Send Pokemon Detail URL from **Pokemon List Screen** to **Pokemon Detail** and use that URL to fetch pokemon detail data.

### Pokemon Detail ###

#### 1. Create layout XML file and other related files ####
For Pokemon detail screen, we haven't provided anything yet. Therefore, you will need to create an XML file and other related files by yourself. You can decide the dimension of the element in the layout base on your judgement.

#### 2. Calling Api ####
Call the URL passing from **Pokemon List Screen** to get the pokemon detail data. Then display the data on the UI.
